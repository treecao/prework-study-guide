# <Tree's First README :)>

## Description

This is a project for a coding bootcamp prework class. The purpose behind building this project is 1.) to learn fundamental coding to prepare for class and 2.) to create a study guide to reference once class has begun.

I've built this project with the guidance of very detailed modules. I'm able to successfully complete my project by following the modules step-by-step. Along the way, I've picked up a lot of new skills!

## Usage

This Prework Study Guide can be used as a quick reference to HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git. 

Additionally, if you open the DevTools console, you'll see the JavaScript running lists the topics learned from prework. It is set up to randomly choose a topic to study :)
